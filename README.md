# chronolog_data

This is a dataset of 681 gamma-ray well logs from the Permian Basin, West Texas that can be used to test log correlation techniques. The data was derived from the S&P Global Permian Basin Digital Logs Subscription and is shared with permission. Each CSV file corresponds with one log, with depth values given in meters below sea level (negative values = above sea level). There is also a CSV file ('example_dataset_coordinates.csv') that contains the UTM coordinates of the surface location of each well.
